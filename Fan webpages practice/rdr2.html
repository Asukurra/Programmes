                        Arthur Morgan is a fictional character and the playable protagonist of the 2018 video game Red Dead Redemption 2. A high-ranking member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West while attempting to survive against government forces and other adversaries in a fictionalized representation of the American frontier. He is portrayed by Roger Clark through performance capture.

                        Rockstar Games decided to focus Red Dead Redemption 2 on one character, in order to follow him more personally. They felt that this was more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western. Clark wanted to play Arthur in a manner that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He took inspiration from actors such as Toshiro Mifune, John Wayne, and Rob Wiethoff, who played John Marston in the game and its predecessor.

                        Arthur has received acclaim from critics, with his complexity and path to redemption most frequently the subject of praise. Reviewers also lauded him for bringing the world and other characters to life. For his work, Clark accrued numerous nominations and was awarded Best Performance at The Game Awards.

                        In the First Chapter Colter: Sadie Adler was encountered by the Van Der Linde Gang, after the latter's killed off the O'Driscolls. Wary of these strangers (particularily Micah Bell), she soon calms down shortly before escaping her burning house, having nowhere to go, Dutch affirms her that she could stay with them and introduces her to the gang where he has Tilly and Karen comfort her.

                        Sadie spends the Second chapter: Horshoe Overlook: mourning the death of her husband where, she is either seen sitting by herself or being consoled by Abigail and several other members of the gang. She also reluctantly helps Pearson with the cooking.

                        In the Third chapter Clemens Point: Arthur catches Sadie in an argument with Pearson, due to her being unhappy with chopping vegetables all day (being more accustomed to sharing the work, like she did with her husband). Arthur defuses the situation by letting her accompany him into Rhodes to re-stock on supplies, at this time Sadie buys some a new outfit in addition to shopping.

                        John Marston is a fictional character in the Red Dead video game series by Rockstar Games. He is the playable protagonist of the 2010 video game Red Dead Redemption, wherein he must deal with the decline of the Wild West while later being forced to hunt down the last surviving members of his old gang in exchange for his family. John is also the protagonist of Undead Nightmare, the zombie apocalypse-themed downloadable content. The character returned as the secondary playable protagonist of the 2018 prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, which depicts his life in the gang and his attempts to start a life for his family.

                        John is portrayed by Rob Wiethoff through performance capture. The character was developed to be a nuanced, family-focused character in the first game. When returning for the prequel, Wiethoff looked to his younger life for inspiration. The writers felt that John's original role could be limiting in the second game. The character was well received, with many critics citing his maturity, moral complexity and ambiguity, and quest for atonement as focal points of the first game. Wiethoff's portrayal of Marston was also met with acclaim.

                        <br>
                        Dutch was born in 1855[1] to an English woman named Greta and a Dutch father somewhere near Philadelphia. His father fought for the Union in the American Civil War and died in battle (heavily implied to be the Battle of Gettysburg); because of his father's death, Van der Linde developed a sworn grudge against Southerners. At the age of 15, he left his home as he was a disobedient child and rarely got along with his mother, who died in 1881 and was buried in Blackwater, although Dutch only found out several years later from an uncle of his.

                        <br>
                        Van der Linde valued freedom and liberties above all else and dreamed of living an independent existence. To attain these desires, Dutch began to resort to a life of crime. In the mid-1870s,[2] Dutch met a con artist named Hosea Matthews at a campfire on the road to Chicago. Hosea attempted to rob him only to realize that Dutch likewise had done the same and stolen from him. Impressed by the other's skills, the pair laughed and decided to partner up and founded the Van der Linde gang.

                        <br>
                        Dutch and Hosea later found themselves in the town of Kettering, Ohio, where the two posed as international merchants, conning twelve locals into buying $300 worth of shares into a fictional Portuguese shipping company. Unfortunately they were eventually discovered and arrested by Sheriff Carmichael. On March 9th, 1877, the pair managed to escape from their cell by unknown means, tying up and robbing the sheriff in the process.
